# CodeSignal Assigment:
# Given a string with constraints of 4 seconds runtime max, string inputString, 1<= inputString.length <= 10^5
# output if the string is a palindrome or not

# My code:
def solution(inputString):
    # compare ends of the string to each other and move in towards the center of the string
    # 
    # x = len(inputString)
    # y = x / 2
    # z = y - 0.5
    # for char in iS:
    #   if iS[char] == iS[x]:
    #     
    #   else:
    #       return False
